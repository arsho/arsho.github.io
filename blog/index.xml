It focuses on answering the question of what to achieve, rather than how to achieve it. This contrasts with imperative programming (e.g. C++, Python, JavaScript, Java etc.), which is focused on specifying the exact sequence of instructions (the how) to perform a specific task or reach a desired result (the what).</description></item><item><title>Recursive queries in SQL and Datalog</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/recursive-queries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 10:13:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/recursive-queries/</guid><description>Recursive queries are a type of database query that involves recursively traversing and querying hierarchical or self-referential data structures. They are particularly useful for querying data that has a nested or hierarchical representation. Recursive queries enable developers to navigate and process these complex data structures by iteratively applying a set of rules or conditions until a termination criterion is met.
Recursive queries in SQL Recursive queries were introduced as part of the SQL:1999 standard which is known as SQL3, a major revision to the SQL language1.</description></item><item><title>Monotonic and nonmonotonic reasoning in Datalog</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/monotonic-nonmonotonic-reasoning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 07:13:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/monotonic-nonmonotonic-reasoning/</guid><description>Datalog1, a declarative logic programming language, is known for its ability to express knowledge and relationships between data. When reasoning about this knowledge, the way new information affects existing conclusions plays a crucial role. This article gives an introduction to monotonic and nonmonotonic reasoning in Datalog, exploring how adding information can influence the inferences drawn from a knowledge base.
Monotonic reasoning: Stable and Predictable Monotonic reasoning is a fundamental concept in logic, where adding new information to a knowledge base preserves the existing conclusions.</description></item><item><title>Install Soufflé on Ubuntu using Docker</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/install-souffl%C3%A9-on-ubuntu-docker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 10:17:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/install-souffl%C3%A9-on-ubuntu-docker/</guid><description>What is Soufflé? Datalog is a logic-based query programming language that allows users to write recursive queries at-ease. Datalog does not have unified specifications for its syntax, so each implementation may differ. Soufflé1 is an open source &amp;ldquo;state of the art&amp;rdquo; Datalog engine that uses OpenMP for parallelization in C++. It provides a compiler to translate Datalog programs into efficient C++ code, enabling Soufflé to handle large datasets while maintaining fast execution speeds.</description></item><item><title>Install deal.II on Ubuntu using Docker</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/install-dealii-on-ubuntu-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 10:17:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/install-dealii-on-ubuntu-docker/</guid><description>What is deal.II? deal.II1 is an open source software library written in C++ for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM).

This means you can write single-source C++ code that utilizes the power of various processors like CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs in a single program. This improves code maintainability and portability across different hardware platforms.
Core characteristics of SYCL:
Single-source programming: Write code once and target diverse hardware architectures without rewriting for each device.</description></item><item><title>cuDF vs Pandas dataframe performance comparison</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/cudf-vs-df/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 08:01:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/cudf-vs-df/</guid><description>cuDF is a Python GPU DataFrame library with similar functionalities to Pandas DataFrame. It can be used for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and manipulating large datasets leveraging GPU programming models. cuDF provides a pandas-like API, so the developers or data scientists do not need to dive deeper into the CUDA programming model. It is a part of the Rapids suite that utilizes the NVIDIA CUDA® programming model to expose high bandwidth memory speed and GPU parallelism.</description></item><item><title>Run a Python script inside a virtual environment in the background</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/python-background/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 03:03:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/python-background/</guid><description>Scenario Suppose, we have a Python script that uses some Python packages. To keep the global environment clean, we use a virtual environment (venv) to install the dependencies. Let&#39;s assume, the script requires a long time to finish. We may need to check the intermediate results (e.g. print statement debugging) from the script during the execution process. We also want to run the script in the background without blocking a terminal window.</description></item><item><title>Sorting a list (Python 3)</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/sorting-a-list-python3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 07:01:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/sorting-a-list-python3/</guid><description>There are a lot of sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Counting sort, etc. But most of the time, we use builtin sorting function to sort an iterable (e.g. list, tuple, dictionary, custom class with iterator etc.).
Today we will sort a given list of strings in several ways to understand the Python 3 built-in sorted function .
Dataset We will use the 50 U.S. states as our dataset.</description></item><item><title>Merge Sort</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/merge-sort/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 01:00:15 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/merge-sort/</guid><description>Divide and conquer strategy and merge sort In a divide and conquer strategy, a problem is divided into multiple subproblems. These subproblems are similar to the original problem but smaller in size. The divide and conquer strategy solves these subproblems recursively. Then it combines the solutions of the subproblems to develop a final solution for the original problem. Thus, the divide and conquer strategy has two parts: divide and conquer.</description></item><item><title>Bubble Sort</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/bubble-sort/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 03:03:14 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/bubble-sort/</guid><description>In the bubble sort algorithm, each pair of consecutive elements are swapped if they are not in the correct order. In each iteration, it places an element at its right place. Thus in n iterations, all n elements are sorted accordingly.
Bubble sort characteristics Impractical Bubble sort is one of the fundamental sorting algorithms to learn how sorting works. It is not a practical sorting algorithm for its poor performance. Though bubble sort has the same time complexity as insertion sort, insertion sort is more efficient than bubble sort.</description></item><item><title>Install Gatsby on Ubuntu 20.04</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/install-gatsby-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 05:05:11 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/install-gatsby-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>What is Gatsby? Gatsby is a React based build time static site generator that uses Webpack and GraphQL. It makes easy to work with data in React apps. It contains GraphQL data layer. During build time Gatsby fetches all the data, renders the entire website into static HTML, CSS, JS files with the data available at that time.

Time complexity describes the computational time required to run an algorithm for a set of input elements. It is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.
Asymptotic notations Three types of asymptotic notations are used to express both the time complexity and space complexity of an algorithm. We will compare these notations by three different scenarios of the same algorithm, the linear search algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Run YesWorkflow Docker Image on Ubuntu 20.04</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/yesworkflow-docker-run/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:05:42 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/yesworkflow-docker-run/</guid><description>YesWorkflow YesWorkflow is a modeling and provenance management tool for scripting languages.

It is quite efficient for small data sets. Though it has same complexity than other quadratic sorting algorithms like selection sort or bubble sort, insertion sort is more efficient.
Adaptive Insertion sort is adaptive. If the input data set is already sorted, the number of steps are reduced.
