This means you can write single-source C++ code that utilizes the power of various processors like CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs in a single program. This improves code maintainability and portability across different hardware platforms.
Core characteristics of SYCL:
Single-source programming: Write code once and target diverse hardware architectures without rewriting for each device.</description></item><item><title>cuDF vs Pandas dataframe performance comparison</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/cudf-vs-df/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 08:01:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/cudf-vs-df/</guid><description>cuDF is a Python GPU DataFrame library with similar functionalities to Pandas DataFrame. It can be used for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and manipulating large datasets leveraging GPU programming models. cuDF provides a pandas-like API, so the developers or data scientists do not need to dive deeper into the CUDA programming model. It is a part of the Rapids suite that utilizes the NVIDIA CUDAÂ® programming model to expose high bandwidth memory speed and GPU parallelism.</description></item><item><title>Run a Python script inside a virtual environment in the background</title><link>https://arshovon.com/blog/python-background/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 03:03:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://arshovon.com/blog/python-background/</guid><description>Scenario Suppose, we have a Python script that uses some Python packages. To keep the global environment clean, we use a virtual environment (venv) to install the dependencies. Let&#39;s assume, the script requires a long time to finish. We may need to check the intermediate results (e.g. print statement debugging) from the script during the execution process. We also want to run the script in the background without blocking a terminal window.</description></item></channel></rss>
