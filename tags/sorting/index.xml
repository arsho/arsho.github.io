      <description>There are a lot of sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Counting sort, etc. But most of the time, we use builtin sorting function to sort an iterable (e.g. list, tuple, dictionary, custom class with iterator etc.).
Today we will sort a given list of strings in several ways to understand the Python 3 built-in sorted function .
Dataset We will use the 50 U.S. states as our dataset.</description>

      <description>Divide and conquer strategy and merge sort In a divide and conquer strategy, a problem is divided into multiple subproblems. These subproblems are similar to the original problem but smaller in size. The divide and conquer strategy solves these subproblems recursively. Then it combines the solutions of the subproblems to develop a final solution for the original problem. Thus, the divide and conquer strategy has two parts: divide and conquer.</description>

      <description>In the bubble sort algorithm, each pair of consecutive elements are swapped if they are not in the correct order. In each iteration, it places an element at its right place. Thus in n iterations, all n elements are sorted accordingly.
Bubble sort characteristics Impractical Bubble sort is one of the fundamental sorting algorithms to learn how sorting works. It is not a practical sorting algorithm for its poor performance. Though bubble sort has the same time complexity as insertion sort, insertion sort is more efficient than bubble sort.</description>

      <description>Characteristics Simple implementation Insertion sort can be implemented easily with less lines of code. It is quite efficient for small data sets. Though it has same complexity than other quadratic sorting algorithms like selection sort or bubble sort, insertion sort is more efficient.
Adaptive Insertion sort is adaptive. If the input data set is already sorted, the number of steps are reduced.
Online Insertion sort works on the data as it receives it.</description>

      <title>Counting Sort</title>

      <description>Characteristics Non negative integers with a known maximum value Counting sort can be applied if the input numbers are in the set {0, 1, .. ,k}, a set of non negative integers with a maximum value k.
No comparisons between elements There are no comparisons between input elements that take place in counting sort. It uses array indexing to determine the relative order of the input numbers. It identifies the relative positions of each input element.</description>
